# Introduction to GDB: Binary Analysis Challenge Writeup
## Event Overview
This writeup documents our team's methodology and solutions for the "intro2gdb" binary analysis challenge that was part of the Asia Pacific University International Capture The Flag (ICTF) 2025 competition. 

The ICTF is an annual team-based cybersecurity competition that tests participants' skills across various domains including binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, web security, and forensics.

## Challenge Information
- **Category**: Binary Exploitation/Reverse Engineering
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Points**: 500
- **Author**: @jeepee.
- **Description**: *"Answer these few questions and you can get the flag :D"*

## Tools Used
- GDB with pwndbg extension
- Netcat for server communication
- Linux command-line utilities
- Kali Linux environment


## Initial Binary Analysis

First, I examined the binary to understand its basic properties:

```console
$ file intro2gdb
intro2gdb: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, not stripped
```

The binary is not stripped, meaning it retains debugging symbols and function names, which will aid in our analysis.

## Loading the Binary in GDB

```console
$ gdb ./intro2gdb

## Question 1: What is the name of the function at position #7 in the stack?

After connecting to the server, I'm presented with this first question asking about a function at position #7 in the stack. Since this is a GDB challenge, I need to examine the function call stack.

First, I load the binary into GDB:

```console
$ gdb ./intro2gdb
```

I start by getting a general overview of what functions are available in the binary:

```console
pwndbg> info functions
All defined functions:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x0000000000001000  _init
0x0000000000001030  printf@plt
0x0000000000001040  fgets@plt
0x0000000000001050  malloc@plt
0x0000000000001060  setvbuf@plt
0x0000000000001070  __cxa_finalize@plt
0x0000000000001080  _start
0x00000000000010b0  deregister_tm_clones
0x00000000000010e0  register_tm_clones
0x0000000000001120  __do_global_dtors_aux
0x0000000000001160  frame_dummy
0x0000000000001169  setup
0x00000000000011ac  callee
0x00000000000011e3  being_called_again
0x00000000000011f4  another_caller_function
0x0000000000001205  big_caller_function
0x0000000000001216  make_heap
0x000000000000126e  main
0x00000000000012ce  sussy_function
0x000000000000132c  _fini
```

I notice a series of functions with interesting names that suggest they might be part of a call chain: `setup`, `callee`, `being_called_again`, `another_caller_function`, and `big_caller_function`. These names look suspicious, as they seem designed to form a stack.

Let me set a breakpoint at `main` and run the program:

```console
pwndbg> break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1272
pwndbg> run
```

Now I want to understand how these functions interact. I'll disassemble some of them to see if there's a calling pattern:

```console
pwndbg> disassemble another_caller_function
Dump of assembler code for function another_caller_function:
   0x00000000000011f4 <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x00000000000011f5 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x00000000000011f8 <+4>:     mov    eax,0x0
   0x00000000000011fd <+9>:     call   0x11e3 <being_called_again>
   0x0000000000001202 <+14>:    nop
   0x0000000000001203 <+15>:    pop    rbp
   0x0000000000001204 <+16>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

Interesting! I can see that `another_caller_function` calls `being_called_again`. Let me check that one too:

```console
pwndbg> disassemble being_called_again
Dump of assembler code for function being_called_again:
   0x00000000000011e3 <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x00000000000011e4 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x00000000000011e7 <+4>:     mov    eax,0x0
   0x00000000000011ec <+9>:     call   0x11ac <callee>
   0x00000000000011f1 <+14>:    nop
   0x00000000000011f2 <+15>:    pop    rbp
   0x00000000000011f3 <+16>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

And `being_called_again` calls `callee`. I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let me try to mentally model what the stack would look like during execution:

1. The program starts with `_start`
2. `_start` calls `__libc_start_main`
3. `__libc_start_main` calls `main`
4. Looking at main's disassembly, it probably calls `setup`
5. Somehow `setup` leads to `callee`
6. `callee` is called by `being_called_again`
7. `being_called_again` is called by `another_caller_function`
8. `another_caller_function` might be called by `big_caller_function`

If I visualize the stack during execution, with the most recent function at the bottom:

```
_start (#0)
__libc_start_main (#1)
main (#2)
setup (#3)
? (#4)
callee (#5)
being_called_again (#6)
another_caller_function (#7)
big_caller_function (#8) <- Current function
```

Counting from 0 at the top of the stack, `another_caller_function` would be at position #7.

**Answer to Question 1: another_caller_function**

### Visual Representation of the Stack

To better understand how the functions are stacked during execution, here's a visualization of the call stack:

```
+----------------------+
| _start               | <-- Bottom of stack (oldest)
+----------------------+ Position #0
| __libc_start_main    |
+----------------------+ Position #1
| main                 |
+----------------------+ Position #2
| setup                |
+----------------------+ Position #3
| big_caller_function  |
+----------------------+ Position #4
| callee               |
+----------------------+ Position #5
| being_called_again   |
+----------------------+ Position #6
| another_caller_function |
+----------------------+ Position #7 (The function we need)
| ...                  | <-- Top of stack (most recent)
+----------------------+
```

This diagram shows the call sequence with the oldest function call at the bottom. Looking at the stack from bottom to top (which is how GDB presents it when we count from 0), `another_caller_function` occupies position #7.

## Question 2: Search pattern for a "Secret" and submit what you found

After solving the first question, I'm now prompted to search for a "Secret" pattern. This seems straightforward - I need to look for strings with "Secret" in them.

Let me run the program again and examine the memory:

```console
pwndbg> break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1272
pwndbg> run
```

After hitting the breakpoint, I can see from the disassembly that the program is about to construct a string:

```console
pwndbg> disassemble main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x000055555555526e <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x000055555555526f <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
=> 0x0000555555555272 <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x20
   0x0000555555555276 <+8>:     movabs rax,0x3a20746572636553    # "Secret :"
   0x0000555555555280 <+18>:    movabs rdx,0x745f4e69344c7020    # " pL4iN_t"
   0x000055555555528a <+28>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rax
   0x000055555555528e <+32>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x18],rdx
   0x0000555555555292 <+36>:    movabs rax,0x317254735f377833    # "3x7_sTr1"
   0x000055555555529c <+46>:    mov    edx,0x676e                # "ng"
   0x00005555555552a1 <+51>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rax
   0x00005555555552a5 <+55>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rdx
   ...
```

I can see that the program is about to construct a string by loading various parts into registers and then storing them in memory. Let me execute these instructions to see the complete string:

```console
pwndbg> nexti 10  # Execute the next 10 instructions to get past the string construction
```

Now I can examine the memory where the string should be stored:

```console
pwndbg> x/s $rbp-0x20
0x7fffffffe130: "Secret : pL4iN_t3x7_sTr1ng"
```

Perfect! I've found the string "Secret : pL4iN_t3x7_sTr1ng" in memory. Looking at the question again, it's asking for what comes after "Secret : ", which is "pL4iN_t3x7_sTr1ng".

**Answer to Question 2: pL4iN_t3x7_sTr1ng**

## Question 3: Search for suspicious variables and submit its value

Moving on to the third question, I need to search for "suspicious variables" in the binary. This is a bit vague, but in CTF challenges, "suspicious" often means unusual or out-of-place values.

Let me search through the binary for anything that stands out:

```console
pwndbg> info variables
All defined variables:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x000000000000037c  __abi_tag
0x0000000000002000  _IO_stdin_used
0x0000000000002010  __GNU_EH_FRAME_HDR
0x0000000000002200  __FRAME_END__
0x0000000000003dd0  __frame_dummy_init_array_entry
0x0000000000003dd8  __do_global_dtors_aux_fini_array_entry
0x0000000000003de0  _DYNAMIC
0x0000000000003fe8  _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_
0x0000000000004020  __data_start
0x0000000000004020  data_start
0x0000000000004028  __dso_handle
0x0000000000004040  sussy_variable
0x0000000000004060  arr
0x0000000000004080  __TMC_END__
0x0000000000004080  __bss_start
0x0000000000004080  _edata
0x0000000000004080  stdout
...
```

Interesting! I see a variable named `sussy_variable` in the output. The name itself looks suspicious as it contains the word "sussy" (slang for suspicious), just like the "sussy_function" we'll encounter later. Let me examine its value:

```console
pwndbg> x/wx 0x4040
0x4040: 0x00c0ffee
```

Perfect! The variable is named suspiciously and contains the hex value `0xc0ffee`. This is almost certainly what the question is asking for - a variable with a "suspicious" value.

In CTF challenges, values like 0xc0ffee, 0xdeadbeef, or 0x1337 are commonly used as markers or flags, making them stand out as "suspicious" in the context of reverse engineering.

**Answer to Question 3: 0xc0ffee**

## Question 4: Search the heap for suspicious strings and submit its decoded value

For question 4, I need to search the heap for suspicious strings. First, I need to understand how and where the heap is used in this program.

Looking at the function names I identified earlier, I notice one called `make_heap`. That seems like a good place to start:

```console
pwndbg> disassemble make_heap
Dump of assembler code for function make_heap:
   0x0000555555555216 <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x0000555555555217 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000055555555521a <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x10
   0x000055555555521e <+8>:     mov    edi,0x80
   0x0000555555555223 <+13>:    call   0x555555555050 <malloc@plt>
   0x0000555555555228 <+18>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax
   0x000055555555522c <+22>:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x0000555555555230 <+26>:    movabs rdx,0x304e6a636a4e7a63
   0x000055555555523a <+36>:    movabs rcx,0x6642484e7a673058
   0x0000555555555244 <+46>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rax],rdx
   0x0000555555555247 <+49>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rax+0x8],rcx
   0x000055555555524b <+53>:    movabs rsi,0x4d79647a63664248
   0x0000555555555255 <+63>:    movabs rdi,0x3d3d775a483557
   0x000055555555525f <+73>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rax+0xd],rsi
   0x0000555555555263 <+77>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rax+0x15],rdi
   0x0000555555555267 <+81>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x000055555555526c <+86>:    leave
   0x000055555555526d <+87>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

I can see that this function:
1. Allocates 0x80 bytes on the heap using malloc
2. Stores the pointer to this memory in [rbp-0x8]
3. Loads several values into registers and then stores them at specific offsets from the heap pointer

Looking at the disassembly, I notice several immediate values being moved into registers before being written to memory:
- `0x304e6a636a4e7a63`
- `0x6642484e7a673058`
- `0x4d79647a63664248`
- `0x3d3d775a483557`

These look like they could be parts of a string. I'll try to run the program and set a breakpoint after the `make_heap` function has executed to see what's in the heap.

```console
pwndbg> break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1272
pwndbg> run
```

After hitting the breakpoint in main, I'll let the program continue until it calls and returns from `make_heap`:

```console
pwndbg> break make_heap
Breakpoint 2 at 0x555555555216
pwndbg> continue
```

The program will stop at `make_heap`. Now I need to run to the end of this function to see what it puts on the heap:

```console
pwndbg> finish
```

Now that `make_heap` has returned, let's check the heap memory. First, I need to find where the heap is located:

```console
pwndbg> vmmap
0x555555554000 0x555555556000 r-xp 2000 0  /home/kali/Desktop/intro2gdb  <-- main binary
0x555555557000 0x555555558000 rw-p 1000 0  /home/kali/Desktop/intro2gdb
0x5555555592a0 0x555555559320 rw-p   80 0  [heap]  <-- here's our heap allocation
...
```

Now I can examine what's in the heap:

```console
pwndbg> x/s 0x5555555592a0
0x5555555592a0: "czNjcjN0X0gzNHBfczdyMW5HZw=="
```

Interesting! This looks like a base64-encoded string. Given that the question asks for a decoded value, I need to decode this string:

```console
pwndbg> shell echo "czNjcjN0X0gzNHBfczdyMW5HZw==" | base64 -d
s3cr3t_H34p_s7r1nGg
```

There we have it! The suspicious string in the heap decodes to "s3cr3t_H34p_s7r1nGg".

### Visual Representation of Base64 Decoding

The following diagram illustrates the process of discovering and decoding the base64-encoded string on the heap:

```
HEAP MEMORY:
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x5555555592a0: "czNjcjN0X0gzNHBfczdyMW5HZw=="                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
                             |
                             | base64 decode
                             v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "s3cr3t_H34p_s7r1nGg"                                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Base64 encoding is often used in CTFs to obfuscate strings and is a common encoding scheme to identify during binary analysis challenges.

There we have it! The suspicious string in the heap decodes to "s3cr3t_H34p_s7r1nGg".

**Answer to Question 4: s3cr3t_H34p_s7r1nGg**

## Question 5: Search for a suspicious function and submit its name

For the fifth question, I need to find a suspicious function. Given the naming pattern I've seen so far, I should look for functions with unusual or revealing names.

Let me see all the functions again:

```console
pwndbg> info functions
All defined functions:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x0000000000001000  _init
0x0000000000001030  printf@plt
0x0000000000001040  fgets@plt
0x0000000000001050  malloc@plt
0x0000000000001060  setvbuf@plt
0x0000000000001070  __cxa_finalize@plt
0x0000000000001080  _start
0x00000000000010b0  deregister_tm_clones
0x00000000000010e0  register_tm_clones
0x0000000000001120  __do_global_dtors_aux
0x0000000000001160  frame_dummy
0x0000000000001169  setup
0x00000000000011ac  callee
0x00000000000011e3  being_called_again
0x00000000000011f4  another_caller_function
0x0000000000001205  big_caller_function
0x0000000000001216  make_heap
0x000000000000126e  main
0x00000000000012ce  sussy_function
0x000000000000132c  _fini
```

One function immediately catches my eye: `sussy_function`. The name "sussy" is slang for "suspicious" (derived from "sus"), making this function the obvious candidate. It's clearly designed to stand out in the function list as the suspicious one.

**Answer to Question 5: sussy_function**

## Question 6: What secret is this function hiding?

For question 6, I need to find out what secret the `sussy_function` is hiding. First, let me disassemble the function to see what it does:

```console
pwndbg> disassemble sussy_function
Dump of assembler code for function sussy_function:
   0x00000000000012ce <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x00000000000012cf <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x00000000000012d2 <+4>:     mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0x20],0x68
   0x00000000000012d6 <+8>:     mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0x1f],0x31
   0x00000000000012da <+12>:    mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0x1e],0x64

I notice that this function is placing characters one by one into consecutive memory locations, building a string. I can set a breakpoint at this function:

```console
pwndbg> break sussy_function
Breakpoint 2 at 0x12d2
```

However, when I run the program with this breakpoint set, I notice that the program executes but doesn't actually hit the breakpoint for `sussy_function`. This suggests that while the function exists in the binary, it might not be called during normal program execution, or it might require specific input or conditions to be called.

Since I can't reliably examine the function at runtime, I'll analyze it statically by manually decoding the bytes being placed in memory:

```
0x68 → 'h'  (pwndbg> python print(chr(0x68)))
0x31 → '1'
0x64 → 'd'
0x44 → 'D'
0x33 → '3'
0x6e → 'n'
0x5f → '_'
0x35 → '5'
0x37 → '7'
0x40 → '@'
0x63 → 'c'
0x4b → 'K'
0x5f → '_'
0x73 → 's'
0x74 → 't'
0x52 → 'R'
0x31 → '1'
0x6e → 'n'
0x47 → 'G'
0x0  → null terminator
```

When I put all these characters together in order, they form the string: `h1dD3n_57@cK_stR1nG`. This is the hidden secret that the function contains.

The name of the function ("sussy_function") and the effort put into constructing this string character by character suggests this is exactly what the challenge question is asking for.

**Answer to Question 6: h1dD3n_57@cK_stR1nG**

### Visual Representation of String Construction

The following diagram illustrates how `sussy_function` constructs the hidden string character by character in memory:

```
Memory at [rbp-0x20]:
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0x68| 0x31| 0x64| 0x44| 0x33| 0x6e| 0x5f| 0x35|
|  h  |  1  |  d  |  D  |  3  |  n  |  _  |  5  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                       ... continues ...
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0x37| 0x40| 0x63| 0x4b| 0x5f| 0x73| 0x74| 0x52|
|  7  |  @  |  c  |  K  |  _  |  s  |  t  |  R  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                       ... continues ...
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0x31| 0x6e| 0x47| 0x00|
|  1  |  n  |  G  | NULL|
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

This construction method is common in binary challenges where strings are intentionally hidden from simple string analysis tools. By assembling the string byte by byte, the function makes it harder to discover through basic techniques like the `strings` command.

## Question 7: What is the return value of this function?

For the final question, I need to determine the return value of the `sussy_function`. Even though I was able to set a breakpoint on this function, I found that normal program execution doesn't seem to trigger the function call.

To determine the return value, I'll need to examine the function's disassembly code:

```console
pwndbg> disassemble sussy_function
...
   0x000000000001231e <+80>:    mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0xd],0x0   # null terminator for the string
   0x0000000000001322 <+84>:    mov    eax,0x1337               # sets the return value
   0x0000000000001327 <+89>:    pop    rbp
   0x0000000000001328 <+90>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

In x86-64 calling convention, the return value of a function is stored in the EAX register. Looking at the instruction at offset +84, I can see that the function moves the value `0x1337` into the EAX register just before returning. 

This value is particularly significant in hacker culture - "1337" is "leet" in leetspeak, meaning "elite". This is a common Easter egg in CTF challenges.

Since the function doesn't seem to be executed in the normal flow of the program (or requires specific conditions to be called), I can't dynamically verify this return value. However, the static analysis of the assembly code clearly shows that `0x1337` is the intended return value of this function.

**Answer to Question 7: 0x1337**

### Visual Representation of Function Return Value

The following diagram illustrates how return values are handled in x86-64 assembly:

```
sussy_function:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ...                                             │
│ mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0xd],0x0   # Null terminator│
│                                                 │
│ mov    eax,0x1337               # Set return value│
│ ▲                                               │
│ │                                               │
│ │ Return value is stored in EAX register        │
│ │                                               │
│ pop    rbp                                      │
│ ret                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
             │
             │ Function returns with EAX = 0x1337
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Calling function receives 0x1337 as return value│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In x86-64 calling conventions, the EAX register (the lower 32 bits of RAX) is used to store the return value of functions. When a function wants to return a value, it places that value in EAX before executing the `ret` instruction. The calling function can then access this value after the function call completes.
